<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Epsilon Merging Language (EML) is a hybrid pattern-based model merging language. Using EML a user can merge two input models into a target model. All models involved in the process can be of different metamodels and technologies. </p>
<p>EML supports a 2-phase model merging process: In the first phase, matching elements are identified using <a href="../ecl/user/syntax/matchrules.html">match rules</a>. If during the matching phase non-conforming elements are identified, the process stops and the elements are reported to the user. In the second phase, matching elements are merged using <a href="user/syntax/mergerules.html">merge rules</a> and non-matching elements are transformed into the target model using <a href="../etl/user/syntax/transformationrules.html">transform rules</a>. EML re-uses the syntax and functionality of match rules and transform rules from <a href="../ecl/gettingStarted.html">ECL</a> and <a href="../etl/gettingStarted.html">ETL</a> respectively. </p>
