<h2>Merging Strategies </h2>

<p>To allow users incorporate merging algorithms in Java, ECL provides the concept of merging strategies. A merging strategy is a class that extends the abstract class <code>org.epsilon.eml.strategy.MergingStrategy</code>. Extending this class requires the definition of an <code>autoMerge(Object left, Object right, EmlContext context)</code> method that is responsible for merging elements of the input models. As an example of a merging strategy, <code>org.epsilon.eml.strategy.emf.CommonEmfMetamodelStrategy</code> merges EMF elemenets of the same metaclass automatically using the follwoing rules</p>
<ul>
	<li> For single valued features the value of the left element is preffered
	<li> For multi valued features the union of the values of both elements is used
</ul>
<h3>Overriding the merging strategy</h3>
<p>The matching strategy is invoked for two matchign input elements when no merge-rule addresses them. Therefore, to override the merging strategy for a specific type of elements one has to specify a merge rule that addresses them.</p>
<h3>Complementing the matching stategy</h3>
<p>Sometimes the functionality of a merging strategy is very close but not identical to the desirable functionality for a specific problem. In such cases users can use the <code><a href="mergerules.html">auto</a></code><a href="mergerules.html"> keyword</a> to complement the functionality of the strategy for specific types of elements in the input models. </p>
