<h2>Introduction</h2>
Epsilon stands for Extensible Platform for Specification of Integrated Languages for mOdel maNagement.
The purpose of Epsilon is to provide an integrated set of languages for the most common model management
tasks such as model transformation, comparison, merging, validation etc and also to provide an
infrastructure for building new task-specific languages with little effort and duplication. Currently,
the following languages have been implemented in the context of Epsilon:

<ul>
	<li>Epsilon Object Language (EOL)
	<li>Epsilon Transformation Language (ETL)
	<li>Epsilon Merging Language (EML)
	<li>Epsilon Comparison Language (ECL)
	<li>Epsilon Validation Language (EVL)
</ul>

<p>In this documentation the syntax and functionality of these languages are presented using concrete examples.
  To achieve uniformity and consistency in our examples we base them on three reference metamodels: one for 
  <a href="oometamodel.html">Object Oriented</a> systems, one for <a href="dbmetamodel.html">Databases</a> and one for <a href="tmmetamodel.html">Type Mapping</a> between different metamodels.
  The metamodels are provided in the KM3 language. KM3 is a language that abstracts above MOF and EMF and provides
  a textual syntax that is easy to write and to our view makes understanding metamodels easier than when expressed
  in UML-like diagrams. More information about KM3 can be found in 
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gmt/atl">http://www.eclipse.org/gmt/atl</a>.</p>
