<h2>Built-in operations</h2>
<p>EOL provides a number of built-in operations on instances. There are two types 
  of operations. Simple operations and operations declaring parameters. The latter
  apply only to <a href="../types/collectiontypes.html">collections</a>. Documentation
  about the available built-in operations and their functionality is available
  for each EOL type separately (see the types subsection).</p>
<h3>Overriding built-in operations</h3>
<p>For convenience purposes built-in operations can be overriden by the user simply by specifying a user-defined operation with the same name. Even in this case, the build-in operation can be accessed by using the -&gt; operator. An example of overriding a build-in operation appears <a href="../../examples/oo2graphviz.html">here</a> where the built-in <code>println()</code> operation is overriden so that instead of printing to the console it concatenates the source with a string buffer.</p>
