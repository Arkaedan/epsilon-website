<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Epsilon Object Language is a metamodel-agnostic model management language
that builds on the navigational features and the type system of the Object Constraint
Language (OCL). EOL offers the following features:
<ul>
	<li>Multiple model access
	<li>Creation/Modification/Deletion of model elements
	<li>Statement sequencing
	<li>Conventional loops (such as <code>for</code> and <code>while</code>)
	<li>Access to the standard output and standard error stream
	<li>User-defined operations on model elements
</ul>

<h3>The aim of EOL</h3>
The aim of EOL is to be a generic and practical model management language
that supports a number of modelling technologies (such as MDR and EMF). EOL
is usable in two ways: as a standalone language and as an expression language
for supporting tasks such as model transformation, comparison, merging etc.

<h3>Relevance to OCL</h3>
EOL re-uses a subset of the navigational features and type system of OCL.
However, although we anticipate gradual alignment with the latest version of OCL,
we have added some features and removed/replaced others mainly for convenience 
and practicality purposes.
<p>
Therefore, in this manual, we provide documentation for all the features of EOL,
including those re-used or inspired from OCL. This inevitably adds some duplication
between the formal OCL specification and this manual but we consider it necessary
in order to minimize confusion and misunderstandings
about which features of OCL are supported by EOL and which not.
