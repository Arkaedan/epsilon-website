	<project name="SAFECAP">
		<description>Safecap is an Eclipse-based tool for entering and analysing railway junction schemas. The tool can be used for the analysis of control table for junction signals, assessment of capacity impact of signal positioning and train detection circuit boundaries, and also for conducting semi-automatic or automatic changes to schema topology or control tables.</description>

	<project name="Pongo MongoDB Generator">
		<description>Pongo is a template-based Java POJO generator for MongoDB. Instead of using low-level DBObjects to interact with your MongoDB database, with Pongo you can define your data/domain model using Emfatic and then generate strongly-typed Java classes you can then use to work with your database at a more convenient level of abstraction.</description>

	<project name="Event-B">
		<url>http://wiki.event-b.org/index.php/Transformation_patterns</url>
		<description>Event-B is a formal method for system-level modelling and analysis. Key features of Event-B are the use of set theory as a modelling notation, the use of refinement to represent systems at different abstraction levels and the use of mathematical proof to verify consistency between refinement levels.</description>

	<project name="PhpNoDB">
		<description>While having a database is essential for any large-scale website, it can be an overkill for smaller projects/prototypes where read-only access to a small dataset would be sufficient. To save you the trouble of setting up and managing a database if you don't really need one, phpnodb lets you capture your data in a Google Spreadsheet and then generate from it a standalone PHP class that contains an embedded copy of your data.</description>
