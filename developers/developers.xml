		I started developing Epsilon in 2004 and have been leading the project ever since. Nowadays, most of my effort goes into the development and maintenance of EOL, ETL, EVL, ECL, EML, EWL, Eugenia, and the ANT workflow, as well as the release engineering activities of the project. My development activities are supported by the Department of Computer Science of the University of York, one of the most research- and <a href="http://duckdensity.org.uk/uni_info?uni_ID=york">duck-</a>intensive CS departments in the UK, where I'm a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecturer#United_Kingdom">lecturer</a>. If you'd like to discuss how you could contribute to Epsilon, or you're looking to start <a href="http://dimitris.io/research/prospective-phd-students/">a PhD in the field of automated software engineering</a>, do <a href="http://dimitris.io/contact">get in touch</a>.

		I've worked on Epsilon since 2006. For my Masters thesis I developed the Epsilon Generation Language (EGL) for model-to-text transformation, and during my PhD I developed Epsilon Flock, the Epsilon tooling for the Human-Usable Textual Notation, and the latest version of Concordance. I'm currently working with Dimitris and our PhD student, <a href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~jimmy/">Jimi Ogunyomi</a>, on <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-11653-2_6#page-1">adding source incrementality to EGL</a>, which will make it precisely 83.4% more awesome.

        I started working with Epsilon during the summer of 2009, using Eugenia to produce a graphical notation for my Master's final project. After participating in the forums and submitting patches during 2009 and 2010, I joined the project in 2011 and continue contributing to it since then. You can blame me for the EUnit unit testing framework, various improvements on Eugenia, EWL and EOL and the odd bugfix here and there. I completed my PhD in 2013, and I am currently a Research Assistant at the University of Cadiz (Spain). My <a href="http://https://ucase.uca.es/">research group</a> focuses on improving software quality through testing (especially mutation testing) and model-driven engineering. In addition to my current contract, which deals with improving information quality at Cadiz and using MDE to modernize existing ad-hoc solutions, I am interested in seeing how mutation testing could be applied to MDE.

		My Epsilon development career started with some questions about Epsilon, followed by bug reports, feature requests and finally patches to fix/improve Epsilon in order to make it more suitable for my application. I suppose the developers got fed up with my spam and decided to make me part of the team in order to have time for themselves again! Now I am mainly helping out with Concordance and EVL, but if I spot opportunities for improvements (bugs) elsewhere I'll fix them as well.This is all part of my employment at the <a href="http://www.ce.utwente.nl/">Robotics and Mechantronics</a> chair at the university of Twente, where I am <a href="http://www.ce.utwente.nl/ECSSoftware/">researching</a> model driven software development for cyber-physical systems and helping out with software related stuff for the robots in out lab.
