		I started developing Epsilon in 2004 and have been leading the project ever since. Most of my effort goes into the development and maintenance of EOL, ETL, EVL, ECL, EML, EWL, Eugenia, and the ANT workflow, as well as the release engineering activities of the project. I currently pretend to work as a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science of the University of York, one of the most research-intensive CS departments in the UK. I am currently recruiting PhD students so if the prospect of contributing mind-blowing features to future versions of Epsilon sounds like chocolate-covered unicorns - and you don't mind <a href="http://duckdensity.org.uk/uni_info?uni_ID=york">the ducks</a> - do <a href="http://dimitris.io/contact">get in touch</a>.

                   I started working with Epsilon during the summer of 2009, using Eugenia to produce a graphical notation for my Master's final project. After participating in the forums and submitting patches during 2009 and 2010, I joined the project in 2011 and continue contributing to it since then. You can blame me for the EUnit unit testing framework, various improvements on Eugenia, EWL and EOL and the odd bugfix here and there. I completed my PhD in 2013, and I am currently a Research Assistant at the University of Cadiz (Spain). My <a href="http://https://ucase.uca.es/">research group</a> focuses on improving software quality through testing (especially mutation testing) and model-driven engineering. In addition to my current contract, which deals with improving information quality at Cadiz and using MDE to modernize existing ad-hoc solutions, I am interested in seeing how mutation testing could be applied to MDE.]]>
