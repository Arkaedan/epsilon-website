		<theme name="Performance enhancements">
			<description>
				<html:div>
					We are working on enhancing the performance of Epsilon by optimizing the execution 
					engines and the underlying model connectivity framework of Epsilon using big/complex 
					models provided by industrial peers. 
				</html:div>
			</description>
		</theme>
		<theme name="Static Type Checking">
			<description>
				<html:div>
					We are working on the infrastructure that will allow languages in Epsilon to be
					statically type checked to improve usability (through features such as code
					completion) and robustness.

		</theme>
		<theme name="Community building">
			<description>
				<html:div>
					Epsilon already has a substantial user community as depicted by the activity in the eclipse.epsilon newsgroup. We are constantly working on extending the Epsilon community by publishing examples and tutorials online.
