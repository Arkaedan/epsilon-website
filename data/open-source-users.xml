		<description>
		The aim of the LAnguage for REconfigurable dependable Systems (LARES) is to bridge the gap between high-level formalisms and formal modelling languages. LARES provides means for hierarchical modelling, i.e. it separates between the definition of structure and behaviour and introduces scopes to restrict visibility of definitions. The formal semantics of LARES has been defined by means of labelled Markov chains and stochastic process algebra (SPA).

However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no metamodels and Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool that provide support to code generation and schema validation from conceptual data model according to the EER classical notation (i.e., Chen/Elmasri and Navathe's notation -  cf. Fig below). Aiming to overcome the previous shortcoming, we have proposed a metamodel and a CASE tool named EER MetaModel (EERMM) and EERCASE, respectively.</description>

      MDebugger is a platform-independent model-level debugger for UML-RT
      models. It provides live debugging features (e.g., breakpoints) to debug
      generated systems from UML-RT models without using any program debugger or
      referring to the generated source code. To make it platform-independent,
      it uses model transformation (i.e. the Epsilon Object Language) to add
      support for debugging capabilities to the models.
