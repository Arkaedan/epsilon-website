is an enhanced version of the built-in EMF reflective tree-based editor
that enables developers to customize the labels and icons of model
elements simply by attaching a few simple annotations to the respective
EClasses in the Ecore metamodel. Exeed also supports setting the values
of references using drag-and-drop instead of using the combo boxes in
the properties view.<br>
