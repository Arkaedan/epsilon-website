	<example title="Building an Object Oriented model" src="BuildOOInstance">
		<language name="EOL"/>
		<description>
		This EOL program builds a simple Object Oriented model from scratch. It is 
		a useful example of the basic features of EOL.
		</description>
	</example>
	<example title="Annotating an Object Oriented metamodel with Exeed-specific annotations" src="ExeedOO">
		<language name="Exeed"/>
		<description>
		In this example, an Object Oriented ECore metamodel is annotated with Exeed-specific
		annotations so that instances of it can be visualized properly with the Exeed editor.

	<example title="Merging two Object Oriented models" src="MergeOO">
		<language name="EML"/>
		<description>
		This EML merging merges two Object Oriented models.
		</description>
	</example>
	<example title="Merging an Entity model with a Vocabulary model" src="EntityWithVocabulary">
		<language name="EML"/>
		<description>
		This EML merging merges an Entity model with a Vocabulary model specifying the vocabulary
		used in an organization. It demonstrates that EML can be used to merge heterogenous models.

	<example title="Validating an Object Oriented model" src="ValidateOO">
		<language name="EVL"/>
		<description>
		This EVL validation contains constraints and  critiques that validate an Object Oriented model.
		</description>
	</example>
	<example title="Implementing Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm" src="ShortestPath">
		<language name="EOL"/>
		<language name="EVL"/>
		<description>
		In this project an EOL program implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for
		directed graphs. Moreover,
		an EVL module validates that a graph is acyclic and has only positive weight-edges
		as required by the algorithm.
		</description>

	<example title="Generating a GraphViz graph from a MOF1.4 metamodel" src="MOF2Dot">
		<language name="EOL"/>
		<description>
		This EOL program generates a textual representation of a graph that can be
		visualized using the Dot program of the Graphviz (www.graphviz.org) platform.
		</description>

	<example title="Transforming an Object Oriented model into a Relational Database model" src="OO2DB">
		<language name="ETL"/>
		<description>
		This ETL transformation transforms an Object Oriented model into a Relational Database model.
		The type mappings between the OO and the DB metamodel are provided in a separate Type Mapping
		model.
		</description>
	</example>
	<example title="Adding getters and setters to an Object Oriented model" src="OORefinement">
		<language name="ETL"/>
		<description>
		This ETL transformation refines an Object Oriented model by adding a getter and a 
		setter operation for each class attribute.
