=EOL Syntax Updates=
 
In 0.8.8 we extended the syntax of EOL so that it looks a bit more like Java. As the majority of Eclipse/EMF audience are Java programmers, this will hopefully make their (and our) lives a bit easier. Of course all these changes also affect languages built on top of EOL (EVL, EGL, ETL, EML, ECL and EWL).

More specifically, we have introduced:

* double quotes (`" "`) for string literals, 
* Java-like comments (`//` and `/**/`),
* `==` as a comparison operator,
* `=` as an assignment opperator (in 0.8.7)
 
All these changes (except for the double quotes) are non-breaking: the old syntax (`''` for strings, `=` for comparison, `:=` for assignment and `--` and `-**-` for comments still work). Below is an example demonstrating the new syntax:

{{{
/*
 This is a multi line comment
*/
// This is a single line comment
var i = 1;
if (i == 1) {
	"Hello World".println();
}

i = 2; // Assigns the value 2 to i

var `variable with spaces` = 3;
`variable with spaces`.println(); // Prints 3
}}}

If you have suggestions for further Java-ifications of the EOL syntax, please post your comments to the [[../../../forum|Epsilon forum]] or add them to [[https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=292403|bug 292403]].
