= Scripting Simulink models using Epsilon =

In this article we demonstrate how you can create, query and modify Simulink models in Epsilon programs. While the example in this article demonstrates using EOL to script Simulink models, it's worth stressing that Simulink models are supported throughout Epsilon. Therefore, you can use Epsilon to (cross-)validate, transform (to other models - Simulink or EMF-based -, or to text), compare and merge your Simulink models.

== Installation ==
The first time you run Eclipse after installing the Simulink driver you will need to point it to the location of your Matlab installation through the Eclipse `Preferences->Epsilon->Simulink` dialog. In particular, you need to specify the location of the `<matlab-root>/bin/maci64` (or `/bin/win64` if you are on Mac OS) directory and Matlab's `engine.jar` as shown below. If you are on Windows, ensure that `<matlab-root>/bin/win64` is in the system path.

=== Notes ===
* The driver has been developed and tested with Matlab_R2017a and may not work with older versions of Matlab (`engine.jar` was introduced fairly recently).
* If you start getting strange errors about dynamic libraries, chances are that the Matlab paths above are wrong. If restarting Eclipse and correcting the paths doesn't solve this, please post a message to the forum.

== Quick start ==
* Create a new general project (in your nested Eclipse instance)
* Create an empty Simulink model in the project (e.g. empty.slx)
* Create a new EOL file (e.g. demo.eol) and add the content below to it:

{{{eol
// Create elements
var sineWave = new `simulink/Sources/Sine Wave`;
var gain = new `simulink/Math Operations/Gain`;
var saturation = new `simulink/Discontinuities/Saturation`;
var busCreator = new `simulink/Signal Routing/Bus Creator`;
var scope = new `simulink/Sinks/Scope`;

// Position them on the diagram
sineWave.position = "[100 100 130 130]";
gain.position = "[200 100 230 130]";
saturation.position = "[300 100 330 130]";
busCreator.position = "[400 70 410 300]";
scope.position = "[500 175 530 205]";

// Set their properties
gain.gain = 2;
busCreator.inputs = 3;

// Link them
sineWave.link(gain);
gain.link(saturation);
saturation.link(busCreator);
gain.linkTo(busCreator, 2);
sineWave.linkTo(busCreator, 3);
busCreator.link(scope);
}}}

* Create a new Run configuration for your EOL program and add a Simulink model to it, pointing at your .slx (e.g. `empty.slx`) model
* Launch the Run configuration. Simulink should pop up and you should see the model below (which you can edit/run as normal)
