=Exeed Tutorial=
 
Exeed (standing for '''Ex'''tended '''E'''MF '''Ed'''itor) is an extended version of the built-in tree-based reflective editor provided by EMF. The aim of Exeed is to enable developers to customize the appearance of the editor (labels and icons) by annotating Ecore metamodels. As a result, developers can enjoy the benefits of a customized editor for their models without needing to generate one and then customize it using Java. The following example presents an annotated OO metamodel (in Emfatic):

Exeed recognizes the following annotation details for different Ecore constructs:

==EClass==
* `label`: EOL expression that specifies the label of the instance.
* `classIcon`: String that specifies the icon of the instances that conform to the `EClass`.
* `icon`: EOL expression that specifies the icon of the instance. If specified, it overrides the `classIcon` annotation.
