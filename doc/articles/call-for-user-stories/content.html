<h1>Call for User Stories</h1>
 
Over the last few years we've been delighted to see the Epsilon community steadily grow and expand. We'd like to take the opportunity to thank you all for your feedback and contributions.
<p/><p/>
And if it's not too much of a hassle, <u>we'd like to ask for your help</u> one more time.
<p/>
Epsilon is developed and maintained by members of staff at the <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk">University of York</a> (UK) and <a href="http://www.uca.es/">University of Cadiz</a> (Spain). 
In the context of the UK Research Excellence Framework 2014, we (the <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/~dkolovos">York</a> <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/~louis">people</a>) 
need to prepare a portfolio that demonstrates the impact of our research (for some definition of <a href="http://www.impactwrestling.com/">impact</a>). 
<p/>
<b>In this direction it'd be really appreciated if you spare a few minutes to write a couple of sentences/paragraphs on what you're using Epsilon 
for in your company/research and share them with us at <a href="mailto:epsilon.devs@gmail.com">epsilon.devs@gmail.com</a>.</b>
<p/>
All responses, <b>no matter how short or trivial</b> would be very helpful for us. Of course, no user story will be made publicly available without your explicit consent.
