==Bugzilla Conventions==
 
Below are the conventions used by the Epsilon committers to characterise reported bugs according to their status.
 
* New bug: Status -> New
* Assigned bug: Status -> Assigned
* Bug fixed in the SVN: Status -> Resolved/Fixed
* Bug fixed in the latest interim version: Status -> Resolved/Fixed, Whiteboard -> interim
* Bug fixed in the latest stable version: Status -> Closed/Fixed
 
==Release Process==
* When releasing a new interim version, go through all bugs of type [1] and set their whiteboard field to '''interim'''.
* When releasing a new stable version, go through all bugs of type [1] and [2], set their status to Closed/Fixed, and record the closed bug numbers in [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhVF3EZ8Xel-dGU0SmJiWjlieExMMDVZeGZZNF9IaFE|this Google spreadsheet]].
